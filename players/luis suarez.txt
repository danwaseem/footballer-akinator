Your Player is Luis Suarez

Luis Suárez is synonymous with goals, scoring them and creating them. The Barça number 9 has a fighting quality that makes him a winner through and through. The Uruguayan is quick and unpredictable and can shoot with either foot, making him a lethal addition to any strike-force. He is so versatile that he can play as on out-and-out centre forward or on the wings. And he doesn’t just get goals, he supplies them too. In fact, Suárez led the Premier League in assists in 2013/14.
Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz came to the Camp Nou in the summer of 2014 as holder of the Golden Boot and one of the biggest stars in world football. The striker was born in Salto (Uruguay) on January 24 1987, and has signed for five seasons.
