Your Player is Gareth Bale

When speed and skill come together, the result is called Gareth Bale. Gareth is a very complete midfielder and has a lethal weapon in his left foot. He is the first Welshman to play for Real Madrid who he joined after being named the PFA Player’s Player of the Year in the Premier League in two of the last three years (2010-11 and 2012-13), and left a lasting influence at Tottenham Hotspur.
 
The Welshman showed his promise at a very early age. He made his debut for Southampton and the Welsh national team at the end of the 2005-06 season at the age of just 16. At the age of 17, he became the youngest player in history to score a goal for his national team. He progressed so quickly that in 2007 he made the move to a major club like Tottenham Hotspur where he made a huge impact due to his direct style of play.
 
After scoring 26 goals in 44 matches last season, Bale joined Real Madrid in September 2013. In Madrid he has been reunited with Luka Modric, his old teammate at Spurs and has brought his attacking potential to a Madrid team that with Cristiano Ronaldo was already a major force.
