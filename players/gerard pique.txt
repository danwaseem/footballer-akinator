Your Player is Gerard Pique

Considered one of the best centre halves in the world, Gerard Piqué brings together character, class and strength in the air at centre back, something that has made him a key figure in the Barça team. Since he was very young he has been involved with the club and when he was 10 years old he joined the youngest boys' team at the club at that time (Alevín B).
From then on he passed through the various youth levels, picking up titles along the way and winning plaudits in all age categories (Alevín A, Infantil B and A, Cadete B and A and Juvenil B and A). When playing at Cadet B level Tito Vilanova was his manager, who he would coincide with again when he eventually made it into the first team. In all this time of development and learning, Gerard Piqué showed a great ability to adapt to different positions on the field and gained a reputation for goal scoring, despite his defensive position. He has since become a permanent feature of Spain defence, playing every minute of the country’s first ever World Cup win in 2010, and also playing a key role in the conquest of the 1012 European Championship. In 2013 he also took part in the Confederations Cup in Brazil and in the following year he played in the World Cup.
