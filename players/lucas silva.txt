Your Player is Lucas Silva

Quality and defensive assuredness in the centre of the pitch for Real Madrid. Lucas Silva has triumphed from a young age with Cruzeiro and before joining the Whites won the Brazilian League twice, was named in the division's dream team and was chosen as the best defensive midfielder in the League by the magazine Placar.

He always provides cover on the pitch, to which he also adds his great technique for distributing the ball. Although he is not a goalscorer, he has a powerful shot, making him a threat from outside the box. He is also a good long-range passer of the ball.

During his presentation he admitted to being a Madrid fan since he was a young boy and recounted a story from his childhood: “The first time I went to watch a football game was with my dad and brother. My dad had the Real Madrid jersey on. We have a photo of that day together”. Lucas Silva will be looking to follow in the footsteps of other Real Madrid Brazilian legends like Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo.
