Your Player is Kiko Casilla

Large goalkeeper, who stands out for his dominance of the air game and for reflexes that have allowed him to sign spectacular interventions. In fact, it was the goalkeeper of the League that accumulated more stops between the seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15.
Casilla knows perfectly Real Madrid, since he already defended the white jersey in the lower categories. He arrived in the summer of 2000 to Cadet B and was part of the Castile that played in Segunda in the campaigns 2005-06 and 2006-07. In this last one entered in the dynamics of the first equipment and was summoned in several occasions like third goalkeeper.
In 2007 he went to Espanyol, where he settled definitively after two assignments to Cadiz and Cartagena. In November of 2014, after several calls, made debut with the Spanish selection in a friendly before Germany.
