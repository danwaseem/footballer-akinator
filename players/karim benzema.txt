Your Player is Karim Benzema

A precocious talent and widely considered to be one of best all-round forwards in the world, Benzema can make his own chances, finish clinically in the area and make assists for his teammates. He always places his talents at the service of the team.
 
His game is based on power and movement on both wings, skill on the ball and deadly finishing in the last few metres of the pitch. From the beginning of his career at Olympique Lyonnais it was obvious that he would be a great player. During his spell at the French club he collected several collective and individual honours such as the Bravo Award in 2008. It was therefore no surprise that Real Madrid did not think twice about recruiting such a special talent and signed him the following summer.

With loads of experience at the top level under his belt, Benzema lived out one of his dreams by getting to wear the same jersey as his idol, Ronaldo Nazario. The French striker has already won a lot of titles with Real Madrid; including the Champions League, a competition in which he has an impressive goals-per-game average.
