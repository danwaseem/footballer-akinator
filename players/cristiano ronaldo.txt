Your Player is Cristiano Ronaldo

Cristiano Ronaldo is a player who is destined to make history. Thanks to his immense natural talent, the Portuguese forward is a commanding leader for Real Madrid and his national team. Since he arrived at the Bernabéu from Manchester United, his goalscoring figures have just kept on improving to the delight of Madrid fans. He is now firmly established as one of the leading goalscorers in the history of the club and he wants to further improve the already illustrious lists of honours won by the greatest club of the 20th Century.

He has an insatiable appetite for goals, truly immense physical strength, lightning speed, a fierce shot with both feet and he is also a fine header of the ball, all of which make him a constant threat for opposing defenders.

He started his career at Andorinha, a small club from his home town where his father worked as the kit man. At just 11 years of age, he caught the attention of one of the greatest clubs in his country, Sporting Clube de Portugal. This was just the beginning of the unstoppable rise to success of a player who is a born winner and shows a level of drive and ambition that is only found among the greatest footballers in history.
