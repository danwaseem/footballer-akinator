Your PLayer is Dani Carvajal
Local full-back Dani Carvajal started his career at the Real Madrid youth academy and is particularly noted for his speed and the composure he displays in his position. He has been a regular at all level of Spanish international youth football and has earned a European Championship medal at Under -19 and Under-21 level.
 In 2012 he signed for Bayer Leverkusen where he showed both his defensive skills and his ability to push forward and attack (he scored 1 goal and made 7 assists in his season in the Bundesliga). His great work rate, his speed and physical strength all led the German newspaper Bild to choose him as the best right-back in the German league.
