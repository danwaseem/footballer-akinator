Your Player is Jasper

The second Dutch keeper in Barça history brings together excellent reflexes and ability with the ball at his feet. Cillessen is more than used to the possession based style of play at Barça after playing under two former blaugranes, Frank de Boer and Louis Van Gaal. The Dutch keeper stands out for his ability with his feet and his positioning and he is used to playing behind a high defensive line.
