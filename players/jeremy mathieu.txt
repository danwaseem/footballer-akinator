Your Player is Jeremy Mathieu

With his ample experience in the First Division, Mathieu also stands out due to his imposing physical presence and his ability to bring the ball out from the back. This physically strong French international can play in various defensive roles. Being 1.89 metres tall, he is strong in the air and knows how to position himself well on the field. In recent years, he has switched from left-back to centre-back, where his speed and skill have won him a fantastic reputation.
Mathieu started out as a professional playing left-back in his home country with Sochaux, making his Ligue 1 debut in the 2002/03 season. After three years and 97 matches for the club, scoring 13 goals and winning the 2004 League Cup, he switched to Toulouse in 2004/05, where he was soon one of their key players, playing 122 matches and scoring five goals.
