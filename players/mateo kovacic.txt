Your Player is Mateo Kovacic

A midfielder with unquestionable technical quality, he stands out for his skill on the ball, his dribbling and his delivery of penetrating passes. He can play both as an attacking midfielder or in a deeper role, where his high percentage of successful passes is a sure means of getting the side moving. What's more, he also brings the ability to chip in with goals from his position.

This young footballer combines the experience of playing at one of European football's powerhouses in Inter Milan, with the enormous potential for growth that he has demonstrated since the opening years of his career at Dinamo Zagreb

A full international with Croatia, he has stood out as one of his country's brightest prospects ever since making his first-team debut for Dinamo at the age of 16. In his time at the Croatian club he won two consecutive League and Cup doubles, before moving to Italy and becoming a key figure at Inter.
