Your Player is Jordi Masip

Agility and quick reflexes are Jordi Masip’s best qualities. He’s known for his quick movements in goal and, especially, his excellent skill with the ball at his feet. His years as a field player allowed him to develop his passing abilities, a quality that is very important in Barça’s system. Even though he’s not especially tall (1.80 m), Masip dominates areal play, and his agility allow him to deal with complicated plays. He made his debut for the B team on 19 December 2009 in a game against Valencia Mestalla (1-1). He spent five seasons with the B team, first under the managerial guidance of Luis Enrique and then under Eusebio. He featured for Barça B in 79 matches and conceded 101 goals.
He made the leap to the senior side in the summer of the 2014/15 season
