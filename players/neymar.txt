Your Player is Neymar

Neymar is a figure in the present and future of world football. The Brazilian can beat players, score and produce moments of magic. Fast, tricky, clever and skilful – Neymar is particular dangerous one on one, but he can shine in any attacking position, capable of showing his quality on the counter or finding spaces in a packed defence with his stunning turn of pace. Neymar is a lethal weapon against any defence. 
Neymar first represented Brazil at the 2009 Under 17 Championships and following the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he made his debut for the full international team in a friendly against USA, when  - still only 18 – he scored a goal. He was named in the Brazilian squad for the 2012 Olympic Games in London and helped take the team to the final, where they were beaten 2-1 by Mexico.

In the summer of 2013, just before signing for FC Barcelona, Neymar won the Confederations Cup with Brazil, scoring a goal in the final against Spain and being named MVP of the Tournament. Neymar Jr. made his official debut for the Club on 18 August 2013 in La Liga against Levante. The match ended with a Barça victory (7-0).
