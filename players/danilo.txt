Your Player is Danilo

Danilo's combination of power, pace and technique make him one of the best right backs on the international stage. Additionally, his spectacular physique and thunderous strike of the ball make him a real threat when he joins in with attacking moves.

His status as one of Brazilian football's most promising talents was confirmed during his four seasons with Porto, where he also cemented his reputation as one of the best players in his position. Before moving to Europe he had made a name for himself with Santos, a club he won the 2011 Copa Libertadores title with after beating Peñarol.

Making his international debut with the Brazilian first team at 20 years of age, he had already won the Under-20 World Cup and the Under-20 South American Championship with his national team. He picked up a silver medal at the Olympic Games in London, while with Porto he won two League titles and two Portuguese Super Cups. His last season with the Portuguese club was his most prolific in terms of scoring, having closed out the campaign with 7 goals to his name.
