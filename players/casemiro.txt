Your Player is Casemiro

Casemiro is one of the new pearls of Brazilian football. When he started playing for Real Madrid Castilla in 2012/13 he made an immediate impact with his versatility and personality. After performing well for Castilla, he joined the first team squad to strengthen the midfield.
 
He started playing football in the youth team of Sao Paulo, his home town club, and made it to the first team at the age of 18. Despite his youth, he became one of the stars of the Brazilian league thanks to his assured style of play on the pitch. Casemiro was part of the Brazilian Under-20 team that won the South American Youth Championship and the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in 2011. In the same year he earned his first cap for Brazil.
 
Casemiro is a midfielder who is strong coming forward and can also defend well. His powerful physique is obvious, but he is a skilful player too. He links up well with his teammates, has great vision and offers the team plenty of options in midfield. Casemiro was loaned out during the 2014-15 season to Porto, where he played over 40 games and notched up 4 goals.
