Your Player is Marcelo

Marcelo started playing five-a-side football at the age of 9 and by 13 he was at Fluminense. He comes from quite a poor family and almost had to leave the football academy because he couldn’t afford to pay for the bus to take him to training. Nevertheless, his determination and his ability made him fight for what he loved and he was best at: football.
 Marcelo came to Europe when he was 18 having already triumphed in Brazil. He is a very fast, attacking full-back who has worked hard since his arrival to take the opportunities that his coaches have given him to secure a place in the first team.
 In 2006, he made his debut for Brazil against Wales and made his mark immediately. He scored a fantastic goal which showed all of his best features as a footballer. Strength and speed in defence, great skill on the ball and a constant attacking threat on the left wing.
