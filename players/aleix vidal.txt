Your Player is Aleix Vidal

The right hand side is the domain of Aleix Vidal, a player known for his selfless running. FC Barcelona and Sevilla FC reached an agreement for the transfer of Aleix Vidal on 7 June 2015. The 25-year-old footballer from Puigpelat in the southern Catalan province of Tarragona was officially presented a day later, on 8 June at Camp Nou. When Almería were promoted to the First Division, Vidal caught the attention of fellow Andalusian club Sevilla and he made his way to Nervión. It was precisely at Sevilla's ground, the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, when Aleix Vidal finally burst onto the scene. His coach there, Unai Emery, converted Vidal from a winger into a wing-back and he played a total of 31 league games for Sevilla, 22 as a starter,scoring four goals. He was a key figure in Sevilla's Europa League victory in 2015 before signing a five-year contract with FC Barcelona.
The FC Barcelona player is a versatile addition to the squad. He can play on either side of the pitch out wide in attack but perhaps his best position is full back. Aleix Vidal loves to get forward down the wing and look to get behind his opponents’ defence to put in telling crosses.
