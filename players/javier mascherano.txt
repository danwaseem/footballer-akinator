Your Player is Javier Mascherano

Javier Mascherano has been one of the captains of the first team since 2014. A leader on and off the field, his football is a blend of passion and tactical excellence 
Javier Mascherano was unveiled as an FC Barcelona player on August 30, 2010 after the Argentine’s successful spell in the Premier League with Liverpool. The 'Little Chief', as he is affectionately known, is a player who has earned the respect of all wherever he has played. He made his professional debut under Manuel Pellegrini at River Plate, curiously enough after already having made his international debut for Argentina in a game against Uruguay.
Javier Mascherano plays with authority and strength. The Argentine is a born leader who is crucial to Barça's defensive scheme, sweeping up and spotting danger before anyone else. He made his name as a defensive midfielder but as a blaugrana he has played mainly at centre half. Technically equipped to play either role, his strong points are his tactical discipline, his positioning and his reading of the game.
