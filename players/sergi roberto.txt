Your Player is Sergi Roberto

Sergi Roberto is one of the most versatile players in the squad and is known for his ability to get forward and his creativity. Sergi Roberto is one of the most promising players to come out of Barça’s youth system. The quick and technical midfielder has a knack for being part of quick combinations in the middle of the pitch. He is intelligent and physically strong. His consistency, in addition to his natural talent, makes him a player to keep in mind for the future. He has also shown an ability to play at right back which only serves to reinforce the importance of his versatility. 
When Sergi Roberto was 14 years old he traded the town of Reus for La Masia. The ex-Nàstic Tarragona midfielder improved year after year until he became a crucial player for Luis Enrique’s Barça B team.
He continued to make the occasional appearance for the first team when required for the next two years, and was eventually promoted full-time to Gerardo Martino’s team in the summer of 2013, with the number 24 on his back. Under the Argentine coach, he played 27 matches, 17 in the league, 6 in the Copa del Rey and 4 in the Champions League.
