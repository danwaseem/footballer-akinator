Your Player is Luka Modric

Skill and organizational ability at the service of the Whites’ midfield. After starring in three different countries (Bosnia, Croatia and England) and in the European Championship, Luka Modric signed for Real Madrid in August 2012, thus reaching the peak of his football career.
 
The Croatian has always had outstanding vision which allows him to play in several different positions. He started as an attacking midfielder who could play the final ball to forwards but in recent years he has played further back. He now helps out more with defensive tasks and plays the ball out from the back to begin the attack. He’s a versatile player who provides plenty of options for the team.
 
At the age of 18, Luka was named the best player in the Bosnian First Division and was awarded the same title in 2007 in Croatia. He continued his career in the Premier League where he became Tottenham’s record signing and the key player in their midfield. In his four seasons at Spurs, he made 24 assists and scored 13 goals, and earned a deserved reputation as a creative and unselfish midfielder who always aims to help his team.
