Your PLayer is Marco Asensio

Marco Asensio is one of the rising stars of Spanish football. A versatile midfielder, Asensio boasts fine technical ability and excellent vision. It was these qualities which saw Marco shine during his time with Espanyol in La Liga and make his debut with the national team, as well as becoming a member of the Real Madrid squad.
Marco came up through the ranks at Mallorca, becoming a regular fixture in the first team in the 2014/15 season. His excellent performances there saw him sign for Real Madrid in the December of that year, although he would remain with the Balearic club until the end of the season. Following on from victory at the Under-19s European Championship, at which he was named Player of the Tournament, Marco was handed his Real Madrid debut in the Audi Cup game against Tottenham.
His first La Liga outing came with Espanyol, during a loan spell during the 2015/16 campaign in which he make 34 La Liga appearances, scoring four goals and heading his side's assist charts, with seven assists. Asensio's unstoppable rise saw him make his debut with Spain against Bosnia in a warm-up game ahead of the European Championships in France.
