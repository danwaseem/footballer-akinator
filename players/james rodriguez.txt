Your Player is James Rodriguez

Goals, assists, dribbling, pace, talent and versatility. James Rodríguez possesses all these qualities. The Brazil World Cup’s Golden Boot winner is a spectacular player. He is young but has a wealth of experience from spells in the Argentinian, Portuguese and French leagues.

He is a midfielder who can play on both wings and in the centre, and he plays with extraordinary imagination. He started his career in his home country in the ranks of Envigado FC before moving to Banfield in Argentina. He won the Europa League with Porto, three league titles with Portugal, and a Portuguese Cup. After a year with Monaco and a sensational performance at the World Cup, he signed with Real Madrid.

He scored six times at the championships in Brazil and left behind wonder goals such as the volley against Uruguay, which was chosen as the goal of the tournament by FIFA.com users. He was without doubt key to Colombia reaching the quarter-finals for the first time in their history. He was named the man of the match in three of the five matches he played.
