Your Player is Raphael Varane

Varane began his football career at the age of just seven. He showed the first signs of his talent at the Football Training Centre in Liévin (France) and began to develop his outstanding feature as a player, his elegance on the ball. He began to star for the youth teams of Racing Club de Lens and at the age of 17 he made his debut for them in Ligue 1, going on to become one of the stars of the 2010-11 season.
 He was playing for Lens when Real Madrid decided to sign him and, just a year after he arrived, the team won the Liga and the Spanish Super Cup. He has also achieved success in his home country and now plays for the French national team.
 He manages to combine youth with great quality and is a widely admired player around Europe where he is seen as one the most promising young players in modern football. He shows this quality on the pitch where his height means he is formidable in the air, as well as being versatile (he can play as a defender and as a defensive midfielder), composed on the ball, a great tactical reader of the game and also unusually mature for his years (he even captained Lens during his spell there).
