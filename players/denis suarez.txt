Your Player is Denis Suarez

Despite being right footed, Denis feels more comfortable on the left hand side. A technically gifted player, capable of taking players on, he can play in midfield or as a winger. Denis is quick and agile with excellent control and also a constant threat from set pieces. His consistency and his youth make him a talent for now and for the future. His excellent performances brought him to the attention of FC Barcelona and in 2013 he joined Barça B. In his only season with the team he scored 7 goals and claimed 11 assists in 36 appearances. Despite his impressive campaign, the Club decided that his development would be best served in the First Division and so in 2014/15 he was loaned out to Sevilla as part of the deal that brought Ivan Rakitic to Camp Nou.
After a season in Andalusia, Suárez moved to Villarreal in the summer of 2015 on a four year deal. FC Barcelona retained a buy back option on the player and after the midfielder’s outstanding year with the ‘Yellow Submarine’, the Club decided to exercise their right to re-sign the player, paying 3.25 million euros. Denis Suárez was officially unveiled as a Barça player on 6 July 2016 at Camp Nou.
