Your Player is Andres Iniesta

The first team captain, Andrés Iniesta is one of the players who has appeared most for the Club in its history. Elegant and modest, he is recognized as one of the best players in the world. 
Andrés Iniesta joined Barca as a twelve-year-old in 1996 after scouts had spotted him at the Brunette Tournament playing for Albacete. From the start he progressed rapidly through the club's various youth teams and was promoted to the Barça B team for the 2000-01 season, where he almost immediately became the team's main playmaker under coach Josep Maria Gonzalvo.
Intuitive, vertical, fast and intelligent, Andrés Iniesta is a man of many virtues. The midfielder started out in defence for Barça B and before that the club's youth teams. But as he gained in first team experience, he was also moved into a more attacking role. He is now a full-on striker, and is also able to play as a midfielder or on either of the flanks of the Barça forward line.
Iniesta is not only versatile, but also a true professional, being talented yet modest. Especially talented. The player from Fuentealbilla has set standards for other attacking midfielders to follow. Practical and intelligent, he reads the game to perfection and is a constant threat to opposing defences. The Barça number eight is getting better with every year. Always learning, his shooting has come on in leaps and bounds, and he can use either foot, as he showed us so dramatically with his last-gasp winner at Stamford Bridge.
