Your Player is Fabio Coentrao

Capable of bringing both attacking and defensive qualities to the team due to his speed, dribbling and versatility, Coentrão has broad footballing experience at the very highest level. Nurtured in the youth team at Río Ave, he started his career in Portugal. But before his success there, Coentrão had a brief spell in Spain, out on loan at Real Zaragoza to be precise. It was later on at Benfica where he shone playing as a full back.

In July 2011, Fabio Coentrão moved from Benfica to Real Madrid, where he won every trophy possible. In the 2015/16 season he went out on loan to Monaco and after this season in the French league he returned to the Whites. His career with the Portugal national team is also impressive, having already taken part in competitions such as the World Cup and the Euros.
