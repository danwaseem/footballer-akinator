Your Player is Nacho
Nacho is a homegrown player who perfectly embodies the values of Real Madrid. He has been at the club for over a decade having arrived in 2001 as a youth team player. He has gradually risen through the ranks to the first team. Just one month after winning the UEFA Under-21 Championship, he also earned his first full cap in Geneva (Switzerland) against Chile. One of the most important dates in his career was the 23rd of April 2011 when he made his debut for Real Madrid away against Valencia. Nacho started the game which Madrid won 6-3.
Although his natural position is at centre back, he is a versatile player. He plays intelligently in any defensive position and stands out for his speed, calmness, strong tackling and, above all, his great maturity on the pitch in spite of his youth.
